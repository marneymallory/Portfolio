  <h1>Marney Mallory: A programming portfolio</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Marney Mallory and welcome to 
    my programming portfolio! I have been working hard at Epicodus
    and I am excited to share some of my favortie projects with you.
    But first, let me tell you a little about myself!

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the small fishing town of Cordova, Alaska. Both of my
      parents fished commercially and I learned from a young age that hard 
      work and resiliency will get you far in life. 
    </p>

    <p>After graduating High School, I attended the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.
      I studied drawing and painting and eventually transferred to the Oregon College of Art and Craft
      in Portland, OR. 
    </p>
    <p>After a year of art school, I wanted to take my career into a seemingly more practical direction.
      I attended Portland Community College and got my Associates in Dental Lab Technology.
      I moved back up to Alaska and began my career as a Dental Lab Technician. I worked for the same
      company for five years and learned to fabricate both dentures and crowns. I enjoyed the creative 
      and problem solving aspects of my job, but I was beginning to get complacent and I felt like I had 
      more to offer the world than beautiful dentures.
    </p>

  <p>I decided to pursue a career in programming because I wanted to be valued for all of my skills, 
    instead of just my ability to work quickly.</p>
